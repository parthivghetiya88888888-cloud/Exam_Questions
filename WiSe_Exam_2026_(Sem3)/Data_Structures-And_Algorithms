This was an oral examination, therefore there are only verbal questions listed over here.


Exercise 1. Modeling
Translate the following real world situations into a formal model, so that a known algorithm can
be applied.
For each scenario
• Identify the graph type (directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted)
• Define the vertices and edges precisely
• State the algorithmic problem that fits
• name a standard graph algorithm that solves the problem.
Scenarios:
1. A city wants to connect all districts with the minimum total cost for roads.
2. A navigation system must find the fastest route between two locations.
3. A university wants to schedule exams so that no student has overlapping exams.
4. A company wants to check whether all employees can be trained given prerequisite courses.
Exercise 2. Runtime Analysis
Explain clearly and precisely:
1. Big-O, Big-Ω, and Big-Θ notation
2. Worst-case versus average-case runtime
3. Polynomial time versus exponential time
4. P versus NP (high level explanation suffices)
1. How does asymptotic analysis differ from real-world runtime?
2. Explain how algorithms are analyzed with respect to their runtime complexity.
3. In particular, describe how divide-and-conquer algorithms are analyzed. Illustrate your explanation using a concrete example.
Exercise 3. Data Structures
For each data structure, explain:
• Structure and invariants
• Supported operations
• Time complexity of operations
1
1. Binary Search Tree (BST)
2. Heap (Min-Heap / Max-Heap)
3. Priority Queue
4. Hash Map
Compare the data structures:
1. BST vs Hash Map: When would you prefer one over the other?
2. Heap vs BST: Why are heaps not suitable for searching arbitrary elements?
3. Balanced BST vs unbalanced BST: How does balance affect runtime guarantees?
Exercise 4. Algorithms
1. Dijkstra’s Algorithm:
• Explain the algorithm. (You can do so by giving a concrete example.)
• Why does the algorithm fail for negative weights?
• How does the choice of the priority queue affect the runtime?
2. MST:
• Which algorithms do you know that compute the MST?
• Explain one of the algorithms. You can do so by giving a concrete example.
• How do we calculate the runtime of this algorithm?
3. Max Flow / MinCut:
• Explain the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm.
• Explain the Edmonds-Karp Algorithm.
• Which problem does Edmonds-Karp Algorithm avoid compared to Ford-Fulkerson?
• What is a residual graph?

what is hashMap and how does it work?
what is linklist ?
Explain any algorithm.
